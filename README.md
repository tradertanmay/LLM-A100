I need  AWS credit to participate in LLM challenge.

Abstract

I will fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance its capabilities on HELM benchmark. By selecting an appropriate pre-trained model and training it on avilable datset listed on the https://llm-efficiency-challenge.github.io/challenge, I aim to enhance its understanding. This process involves carefully curating the training data and fine-tuning the model's parameters, ensuring it learns to generate accurate and relevant text in alignment with my requirements. Through this approach, I intend to harness the full potential of the LLM, making it a powerful tool customized for this competition..
